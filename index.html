							</p>
							<p class="meta">2025. An essay about F. Scott Fitzgerald's post-Gatsby life and writing.</p>
							<p class="excerpt"><i>Courage requires existing — requires acknowledging we always exist — at the collision point of fantasy and reality, each continually acting on the other. There is no end to fantasy; there is no dominating life. To think otherwise is to consign one’s self to a permanent adolescence.</i></p>

							<p class="meta">2025. An essay about the vast and mysterious filmography of the South Korean auteur Hong Sangsoo</p>
							<p class="excerpt"><i>You don’t have to like arthouse films to like his movies, because you already know how to watch them; the knowing groans and awkward laughter that often accompany screenings speak to this. But in real life, say at a dinner party, you’re caught up in your own concerns, fragmenting what’s happening in front of you into discrete, self-interested signals, into information. In Hong’s films, the long takes and repetitions short-circuit that process, forcing you to look at what’s really there.</i></p>

							<p class="excerpt"><i>The son of a lawyer and the nephew of an uninspired academic painter, Charles Locke Eastlake fought alongside Ruskin and Morris in the British civil war between the gothic and the classical. Though he studied to become an architect, it was in furniture design that he excelled. Like Ruskin and Morris, he tended to talk about design in moral terms, railing against Victorian artifice. Like Holden Caulfield, he hated phonies.</i></p>

							<p class="excerpt"><i>I’ve been nervously pacing, and as I allow myself to breathe once again I discover that I am in my grandmother’s room. The bed missing, the room is a jumble of cardboard boxes and misaligned furniture, strewn in a half-circle around an empty core. I look through her things for a while, searching, perhaps, for a more capacious love.</i></p>

							<p class="excerpt"><i>At issue is two experiences of time, one associated with codex and one with the refreshing web page. The first involves racing forward into the future, awareness of a coming end pulling you forward and a visible, easily accessible past behind you in the form of surrounding text and turned pages. The second involves a continuous present, the narrow aperture of the screen, the past erased with a single algorithmically-generated refresh.</i></p>

Gradually, very gradually, the face of the young woman from the DM, with her restless, uneasy dreams, came before me as I glared at the cold sidewalk. I didn’t want to be her, either, except in one crucial respect: that she would always be a moment away from having to wake, and see where the night had brought her.</i></p>
