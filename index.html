  <i>
    Courage requires existing — requires acknowledging we always exist — at
    the collision point of fantasy and reality, each continually acting on the
    other. There is no end to fantasy; there is no dominating life. To think
    otherwise is to consign one’s self to a permanent adolescence.

                <i>
                  …in real life, say at a dinner party, you’re caught up in your own concerns,
                  fragmenting what’s happening in front of you into discrete, self-interested
                  signals, into information. In Hong’s films, the long takes and repetitions
                  short-circuit that process, forcing you to look at what’s really there.

                  jumble of cardboard boxes and misaligned furniture, strewn in a half-circle
                  around an empty core. I look through her things for a while, searching,
                  perhaps, for a more capacious love.

                  History is about beginnings and endings; in this sense, the Internet knows
                  no history. Rather, it’s simply something that you dip in and out of, but is
                  always there, always accumulating. The Internet is exhausting because,
                  unlike life, it won’t end.

                  Stumps were here and there visible, remnants of wooden crosses gone to rot.

                  of nausea, as if the sheer mass of horizontal bodies momentarily convinced
                  me that they, not I, had the correct orientation.

                  I didn’t want to be me. Did I then want to be Alanna? Gradually, very gradually,
                  the face of the young woman from the DM, with her restless, uneasy dreams, came
                  before me as I glared at the cold sidewalk.
