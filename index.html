        <p>
          Andrew Eckholm is a writer living in New York. He received a B.A. in Philosophy
          from the University of Chicago in 2016 and an M.F.A. from the New School in 2020.
          His stories and essays, often set in New York City, explore themes of desire,
          the link between personal fantasy and artistic style, and frustrated aspirations
          toward the transcendent. His work has been published by America's leading literary
          magazines and in the past few months, his dreams have grown increasingly vivid.
        </p>

        <p>
          He is also an expert on the college admissions process, with previous students
          admitted to every top university in the US, Canada, and the UK, as well as a
          deeply experienced writing tutor for students and applicants at all levels.

    Courage requires existing — requires acknowledging we always exist — at
    the collision point of fantasy and reality, each continually acting on the
    other. There is no end to fantasy; there is no dominating life. To think
    otherwise is to consign one’s self to a permanent adolescence.

                  signals, into information. In Hong’s films, the long takes and repetitions
                  short-circuit that process, forcing you to look at what’s really there.
