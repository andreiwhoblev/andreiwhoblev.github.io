		<h1>Andrew Eckholm</h1>
		<p>Andrew Eckholm is a writer living in New York. He recieved a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 2016, an M.F.A. from the New School in 2020, and his dreams became unusually vivid in 2026 upon receipt of the mandate of heaven. His stories and essays, both of which are often set in New York City, explore themes of desire, fantasy, and frustrated aspirations toward the transcendent. Often, he writes about what happens when when the gap between the world as it actually is and the world as we would like it to be becomes untenably wide.</p>		
		<p>His work has been published by America's leading literary magazines.</p>

		<h3>Nonfiction</h3>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://libertiesjournal.com/online-articles/greater-than-gatsby/">Liberties Magazine: Greater Than Gatsby</a></p>
		<p>2025. An essay about F. Scott Fitzgerald's post-Gatsby life and writing.
		<p><i>Courage requires existing — requires acknowledging we always exist — at the collision point of fantasy and reality, each continually acting on the other. There is no end to fantasy; there is no dominating life. To think otherwise is to consign one’s self to a permanent adolescence.</i>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/review/sympathy-and-indifference/">n+1 Magazine: Sympathy and Indifference</a></p>
		<p>2025. An essay about the South Korean auteur Hong Sangsoo, whose mysterious and vast ovreu reveals the secret of great art, which as it turns out, isn't a secret at all.
		<p><i>Work cheaply and hard. Memorize poems or paragraphs. Cultivate a hatred for careerism sufficient to overmatch the fear of failure. Accept, or try to accept, that failure, however defined, is inevitable. Make use of it, by dramatizing both the appeal and the disappointment of that which has served you poorly. Don’t seek out suffering, but forgive yourself when you do. If you ever make a movie, put interesting things, like clouds, or leaves, in the background. Prefer rewriting to editing. Record interesting things people say. Vigorously pursue interests that have no clear connection to what you’re working on. Think about other people at least as much as you think about yourself. Remain an amateur at all costs. Know in advance the costs will be enormous.</i></p>

		<p><a href="https://nyra.nyc/articles/everybody-must-get-stoned">The New York Review of Architecture: Everybody Must Get ’Stoned</a></p>
		<p>2024. An essay about the shifting form and uses of the New York brownstone over the past two centuries.<p>
		<p><i>The son of a lawyer and the nephew of an uninspired academic painter, Charles Locke Eastlake fought alongside Ruskin and Morris in the British civil war between the gothic and the classical. Though he studied to become an architect, it was in furniture design that he excelled. Like Ruskin and Morris, he tended to talk about design in moral terms, railing against Victorian artifice. Like Holden Caulfield, he hated phonies.</i></p>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://thepointmag.com/quarantine-journal/#saying-i-love-you">The Point Magazine: Saying I Love You</a></p>
		<p>2020. A short work of memoir about the death of my grandmother.<p>
		<p><i>I’ve been nervously pacing, and as I allow myself to breathe once again I discover that I am in my grandmother’s room. The bed missing, the room is a jumble of cardboard boxes and misaligned furniture, strewn in a half-circle around an empty core. I look through her things for a while, searching, perhaps, for a more capacious love.</i></p>

		<p><a href="https://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/time-crises/">3AM Magazine: Time Crises</a></p>
		<p>2020. An essay about time, literature, and the internet.</p>
		<p><i>At issue is two experiences of time, one associated with codex and one with the refreshing web page. The first involves racing forward into the future, awareness of a coming end pulling you forward and a visible, easily accessible past behind you in the form of surrounding text and turned pages. The second involves a continuous present, the narrow aperture of the screen, the past erased with a single algorithmically-generated refresh. Less the experience of moving into the future than the future cascading into the static now.</i></p>

		<h3>Short Stories</h3>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/into-this-clearing-andrew-eckholm">Tablet Magazine: Into This Clearing</a></p>
		<p>2023. A story about grief, graveyards, and pandemics.<p>
		<p><i>The jogger reemerged near the entrance and I imagined what he now saw, the green hills and the citylike extension of graves spreading out all around as he made the rise in the wet cold air. I stepped off the path, eager to avoid his circumambulations, and passed several rows of rusted graves into a declension. Stumps were here and there visible, remnants of wooden crosses gone to rot. The grass was lush. As often happened in cemeteries I experienced a twinge of nausea, as if the sheer mass of horizontal bodies momentarily convinced me that they, not I, had the correct orientation.</i><p>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/ewas-story/">n+1 Magazine: Ewa’s Story</a></p>
		<p>2021. A story about desire and beauty and what we desire when we desire beauty.
		<p><i>The details of our parting were mundane. I attempted prolongation, of course. We didn’t go home together, of course. And as I walked into the night I noticed my steps lengthening, in semiconscious imitation of her stride. I wanted Alanna. But I didn’t want to be like all the other people who wanted Alanna. I didn’t want to be Ryan, I didn’t want to be the drunk or the bartender. I didn’t want to be me. Did I then want to be Alanna? Gradually, very gradually, the face of the young woman from the DM, with her restless, uneasy dreams, came before me as I glared at the cold sidewalk. I didn’t want to be her, either, except in one crucial respect: that she would always be a moment away from having to wake, and see where the night had brought her.</i><p>
		<br>
		<p><a href="https://joylandmagazine.com/fiction/caretakers/">Joyland Magazine: Caretakers</a></p>
		<p>2021. A story about parties inspired by the short stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald and James Joyce, and the novels of Edith Wharton.<p>
		<p><i>Quietly, very quietly, she said, “I’m going to hurt you tomorrow,” and moved back over, settling into the declension where his shoulder met his chest. She would sleep the whole way home, unaware of the big soft wet flakes that had begun to fall over Brooklyn, turning to water as soon as they hit the ground and forming large puddles at the intersections but still, at least for the moment, enameling the limbs of the trees that lined Eastern Parkway. The year’s first snowfall descended, too, upon an deserted roof in Crown Heights, where an empty glass bottle of vodka, several discarded packs of American Spirits, a lidded bucket of what appeared to be urine (there since early summer) and Charles Baikoff’s wallet lay to receive this benediction. It drifted into the stairs through the door that had been listed open, and fell in a slow, diagonal fashion against the windows of the unusually tall brick building. It would snow all night.</i><p>

		<p><a href="https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/the-easiest-job-in-the-world/">n+1 Magazine: The Easiest Job in the World</a></p>
		<p>2021. A story about how easy it is to fuck up the job.</p>
		<p><i>None of us could believe how funny it was. It really just didn’t seem believable. Esther opened her window and took huge breaths. Paul slowed down to avoid crashing. Ethan felt flecks of drool on his facial hair, as did Kevin. And Leo still laughed harder than all of us. He had gone from choking to dry-heaving, from red to crimson. The heavy summer air sparkled. We felt perfectly enclosed.</i></p>
